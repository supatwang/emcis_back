Dear mlpack developers,

the OpenCV Machine Learning Library [1] is another location where C++
implementations of machine learning methods are collected. How do you
position yourself with respect to that library?

E.g., [2] gives the impression that you are not going to wrap 3rd party
methods, like libsvm (as OpenCV does). Is this correct?

Best regards,
Robert

Hello,

is there an archive of this mailing list? The one on
https://mailman.cc.gatech.edu/pipermail/mlpack/ is empty.

Btw., I can recommend setting one up at http://gmane.org/. I found their
search functionality useful, and one can also import a local (mbox)
archive to initialize it.

Robert

Ah!  Sorry, I forgot to answer that question.

The states vector (vector<arma::Col<size_t> >) are the states which
correspond to each observation (the observations vector,
vector<arma::Mat<double> >).  When you train the HMM with Train(), it is
training with labeled data.  So for each observation, you need to pass
the corresponding label.  That is, states[i] is the index of the hidden
state corresponding with observations[i].

In the example you gave, you were only using one hidden state, so the
states vector should be entirely filled with zeroes, and be the same
length as the observations vector.

Thank you for pointing out these issues.  Sometimes, when writing
documentation, it is hard to know what people will find confusing.

That patch is somewhat similar to a mod I tried. Mine helped sometimes, but
not in all situations. Both problems still occur with r14883:

Dear Mrs, Sir,

I have only recently begun learning about machine learning and more 
specific about hidden markov models as I need to use these.
I have a project in C++ and the mlpack library seemed like the best 
option to use for training and using HMM. However I find the 
documentation about HMM somewhat vague on not entirely clear.
There is a piece of example code there but that doesn't work for me.

Here is an overview of what I need to do:
I have a program that throws me data on which i need to train the HMM. 
The data contains discrete as well as continuous data. The data can vary 
between 4 and 27 variables being integers, floats and vector<floats>. If 
I am correct these are my observations as I know what these stand for 
and can extract them with ease.
But I don't need to use all of the different variables at once as I want 
to look at the performance when using every one of them on its own and 
then expanding it to take more variables into account.
For now I want to look at the first variable.
This is a sequence of integer values ranging from 0 to 5 (thus 
discrete), these values are stored in a vector<int> . So here is what i 
try to do:

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
vector<arma::Mat<int> > handvector;
arma::Mat<int> handobservations;
vector<arma::Col<size_t> > states;
int hidden_states = 1; //leaving this on 1 for now

  hmm::HMM<distribution::DiscreteDistribution> handhmm(hidden_states, 
distribution::DiscreteDistribution());
     for(uint i = 0; i<hands.size();i++)  //hands is a vector<int> that 
is created earlier in the code
     {
         handobservations << hands[i] << arma::endr;
         handvector.push_back(handobservations);
         handobservations.clear();
     }

handhmm.Train(handvector, states);
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Now the problem with this is the Train member function won't accept 
vector<arma::Mat<int> >, it only seems to accept 
vector<arma::Mat<double> >.
Also states is left empty for this and that isn't accepted either. So 
what needs to be put in states and is there a way to make train work 
with vector<arma::Mat<int> >?

Any help or a more extended example than in the doc will be greatly 
appreciated.

With kind regards,
Joery

Hello Zhijie (and Salman who had nearly the same question),

The collaborative filtering project is as much of a research project as
it is an implementation project.  As the description says, the project
entails researching what the state-of-the-art is in CF and implementing
it, with an emphasis on scalability.  It is a somewhat open-ended
project, so a good application for that project should already have CF
domain knowledge and ideas for what exactly could be implemented.

You are welcome to submit patches to mlpack if you find bugs, but that
is not necessary for a GSoC application.

Hopefully this information is helpful.

Thanks,

Ryan

Dear Ryan,

First of all I want to thank you for the fast response.
It kind of figured that I could just use double with a simple type 
conversion, but was unsure about the influence on the results.

However I am still left with the question what to do with the 
"vector<arma::Col<size_t> > states;".
Is this the amount of values in one sequence of observed values or is it 
the amount of possible states that it can be, or maybe even something 
else entirely?

In my case I get my data from video samples and the amount of values for 
one video sample vary. I have already changed my code a bit so that the 
values per sample are stored in a different column of the 
"vector<arma::Mat<double> >", meaning that each column contains a 
sequence of values for one video sample and the amount of rows is equal 
to the amount of video samples used. I hope this is the way it is 
supposed to be done, as I have no way of testing it until the my problem 
with states is fixed.

Hi I am a student at the University of Calgary and interested in working =
on one of your projects for GSoC.  I will be in the middle of my second =
year but I do very well on assignments so I am still at early stages of =
my degree but am skilled at programming.   I have done work in Java, =
python, assembly (SPARC architecture) and did some exploration of =
objective C last summer.=20

I was intrigued by your improvement of tree traversers suggestion, I am =
currently in a course that has a component on trees and so did some work =
with them.  I am interested in learning about and learning machine =
learning however I have never programmed in C++.  Do you think this is =
within my skill set that I have laid out?

Thank you,

Hi,

I am Zhijie He, a master candidate at National University of Singapore. My
research interest is natural language processing and machine learning. I
will gradate this May, so I have a lot of time to do the GSoC project.

I am interested in developing a collaborative filtering package for mlpack.
I was wondering before submit my application, do I have to do some other
things like submit a patch for mlpack? Do you have other requirements for
the applicants?

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Zhijie

If you are deadset on doing statistical machine learning implementation
and none of the other less machine-learning-y projects are appealing to
you, I suggest that your best bet is learning C++ and a fairly simple
machine learning method (maybe decision trees of some sort -- which are
different than the dual-tree algorithms I mentioned earlier; or maybe
some rather simple nonlinear dimensionality reduction method such as
IsoMap or LLE).  Keep in mind that mlpack is looking for fast
algorithms, so the off-the-shelf IsoMap algorithm (for example) may not
be as asymptotically fast as some more recently published improvement on
the algorithm (in the case of IsoMap I am not certain if one exists).

Hi All-

I'm trying to use mlpack's GMM with some data I've got. I'm not so familiar
with the statistical tools used here as I should be, so I've run into some
problems that I'm having trouble debugging on my own:

- First, I often get "error: inv(): matrix appears to be singular" during
estimation. It appears that during estimation, one (or more) rows and
columns of a covariance matrix become 0, and I think this causes it to
become non-invertible.

- Second, in cases when estimation completes, I often end up with means,
weights and covariances which are all -nan.

I'm not sure whether I'm mis-using the tool or I've got funny data which
need to be conditioned. It's six-dimensional, values less than 1.0 and one
of the features is very often zero. (I'm wondering if that last bit means
that one good gaussian would be zero mean and zero stdev, resulting in a
degenerate covariance matrix -- though I don't know enough stat and linear
algebra to work this out.) Can someone give some advice?

I've posted a small sub-set of my data which can trigger these problems:
www.cs.columbia.edu/~jdd/gmm_obs0.csv

If I run "./gmm -i gmm_obs0.csv -g 5" I can get the first problem. Changing
the number of gaussians to 8 results in the second problem.

Thanks in advance,
John

Sorry for the slow reply; things have been busy for me.

The problem is here:

> hmm::HMM<distribution::DiscreteDistribution> handhmm(hidden_states,
>    distribution::DiscreteDistribution(observations.n_rows));

The constructor of DiscreteDistribution is defined as (from
core/dists/discrete_distribution.hpp):

> /**
>   * Define the discrete distribution as having numObservations possible
>   * observations.  The probability in each state will be set to (1 /
>   * numObservations).

>   */
>  DiscreteDistribution(const size_t numObservations);

You are giving observations.n_rows, which is the dimensionality of the
observations, and not the number of possible observations.  Your
observations vector contains observation '5', while
DiscreteDistribution() only expects to see one observation.

To correct this, the constructor parameter to DiscreteDistribution()
should be one greater than the highest-numbered state that is observed
(because 0 is also a valid state):

> hmm::HMM<distribution::DiscreteDistribution> handhmm(hidden_states,
>    distribution::DiscreteDistribution(6));

I have modified DiscreteDistribution to provide much better error output
when compiled with debugging symbols (-DDEBUG).  With this change your
example code gives:

----
Ready for training
[DEBUG] DiscreteDistribution::Probability(): received observation 2;
observation must be in [0, 1] for this distribution.

error: Mat::operator(): out of bounds

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
  what():  
Aborted

This is true, but be aware that the DiscreteDistribution class currently
only supports single-dimensional observations.  If you have
multi-dimensional discrete data, you could convert it into
one-dimensional data kind of like this:

  state (0, 0) --> state 0
  state (0, 1) --> state 1
  state (0, 2) --> state 2
  state (1, 0) --> state 3
  state (1, 1) --> state 4
  state (1, 2) --> state 5

I hope this information is helpful, and again, sorry for the slow
response.

Hey,

I am currently working with GMM and it worked for two models with decent 
results up to now.
However when attempting to train for a third model I get mean, 
covariance and transmission matrices filled with NaN.
My input data has 15 dimensions consisting of values that range between 
0 and 4.
My guess is that excessive appearance of the value zero is causing the 
problem and thus I tried adding a very small value to every datapoint, 
but this did not solve the problem.

I am training 7 models with data like explained above. 2 of them always 
give me NaN matrices and take way longer to train so something is going 
wrong with the training.
Could you give me an possible reason for this problem and/or point me in 
the direction to solving this, I have been stuck several hours on this now).

PS. I updated from the repository about 6hours ago (version r14885)

With many thanks,
Joery

Thx for the feedback, it explains and clarifies a lot to me.
I have been digging into the code myself and wondered about the 
dimensionality that is hardcoded on 1 and also about the possibility to 
make one observation value of the vectors I have for each observation,
I also started to implement the hmm algorithms myself today.
However due to your answer I don't think there is any need to continue 
with my own implementation, for which I am thankful as well :p .

I can get the simple example running now and will try to do some more 
advanced test tomorrow.
One more question now though: Is the download on the website the one 
with the updated Distribution code, as it states "released februari 8"

Again many thanks,

Joery

Genetic algorithms are entertainingly slow, so I am not sure how useful
they are in the context of mlpack, which aims to be a fast library.
Also, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms are not the same thing,
but they are both global optimization strategies (in some sense).

You are not restricted to only the ideas in the Ideas List (as it says
on that page), but if you are considering doing some other project, you
will have to detail it in your proposal.  Your proposal will have to
convince us that your idea is a fast algorithm that can be implemented
without additional library dependencies, that you know the algorithm
inside-out and can implement it efficiently, other implementations that
you seek to outperform, and then how it will fit into the existing
mlpack codebase (both from the perspective of code cleanliness and also
the bigger picture of how all mlpack algorithms fit together).

Hopefully this is helpful.  I was not entirely sure how to answer your
question because it was a little vague.

The tree traversal project is a particularly difficult one which expects
rigorous C++ knowledge.  This does not mean that you could not do it,
but in slightly more detail:

Many of the algorithms in mlpack are fast because they are tree-based
branch-and-bound algorithms.  If you don't know about those you can read
them about them online; search for something like 'nearest neighbor' and
'kd-trees'.

In addition, there are many different possible types of trees and many
different machine learning algorithms.  mlpack uses C++ templates to
provide abstract traversals and algorithms which can work with any type
of tree (assuming the user implements the tree with the proper methods).
This is actually very neat and to my knowledge there is no other library
which implements anything even remotely similar.

However, the functionality is still somewhat experimental -- which is
why the tree abstractions haven't been advertised as a main selling
point.  The branch and bound type algorithms to which I was referring to
earlier depend heavily on tight bounds.  So improving the effectiveness
of these tree traversals will depend on the implementation of the bounds
in the algorithms and the efficiency of those bound calculations (as
well as other calculations).

So the project would involve both analyzing the existing traversals for
either algorithmic or implementational improvements as well as examining
the existing algorithms.

I could talk about this all day, given that it is my primary research
interest, but I'll spare the gory details for now.

tl;dr: if you're a second-year undergraduate without heavy algorithmic
knowledge and you're interested in this project, you probably are best
served by putting in 30 hours a week reading papers both on dual-tree
algorithms and learning C++ inside-out (metaprogramming does happen in
the mlpack world of trees).  So, I'm not going to say it's impossible,
but there's a reason its difficulty is rated a 9/10...

I approached a problem like this once; at the end of each AllkNN search,
we were finding an incremental transformation matrix and multiplying the
points by that, then recalculating nearest neighbors.  There are several
ways to do this:

  (1) 

Instead of finding k nearest neighbors, find a * k nearest neighbors
where a is some integer (I chose 10).  Then apply the transformation
matrix and do a brute-force search in the a * k nearest neighbors of
each point.  Every now and then, the tree gets fully rebuilt.  This
gives approximate solutions, though.  This is what we chose to do.

  (2)

For each point x in S_i, you have some corresponding point x' in
S_{i + 1}.  It seems like, in general, || x - x' || is small.

Each BinarySpaceTree<> node has a corresponding HRectBound<>, which is
the hyperrectangle bound that represents the enclosing hyperrectangle of
all the points in the node.

You could loop over each point in S_{i + 1}, find the BinarySpaceTree<>
node it is a part of, and then expand the HRectBound associated with
that node accordingly (using operator|=()).  You'd also need to expand
the HRectBounds of any parent nodes.

This would mean your BinarySpaceTree is no longer a space partitioning
tree -- the nodes would be overlapping.  For AllkNN this is not a
problem; it will still work, but it may affect the runtime adversely,
especially as the bounding hyperrectangles become larger and larger.  In
the limit case you would get a tree with no discriminatory capabilities
because all the bounding hyperrectangles are huge.

  (3)

You could avoid modifying the hyperrectangles associated with each tree
node by taking each point x' and finding which node it fits into, and
placing it in that node (whereas x may have been in a different node).
You could also split a node if it now has more points than the leafSize,
and delete nodes when they have no points in them.

I am not sure about the running time of this approach, but your tree
would still be valid for any number of iterations and it would probably
still run all-NN search quickly (as opposed to approach (2)).

----

Are these ideas helpful?  I think I understood the problem.

As long as you have some sort of valid tree structure with valid
bounding rectangles, the NeighborSearch class will find the correct,
exact nearest neighbors.

The documentation here is somewhat unclear, and I will be fixing that
soon.  The type std::vector<arma::mat> is meant to hold a sequence of
data sequences.  I think you are saying that if you are using 5 videos,
each video is an individual arma::mat stored in the
std::vector<arma::mat>.  Then each point in the arma::mat should contain
one data point in each _column_ (not each row, which is what you wrote).

I suspect that if you transposed your data matrices, it would work.  In
addition to updating the documentation, I'll also add some runtime size
checks so that you'll get something more useful than "Mat::operator():
out of bounds".

That's what this list is for. :)

Sometimes the hardest part of development is producing good
documentation and often times that takes a lot of feedback; so I am very
thankful that you've brought this up, because now it can be improved.

Thanks,

Ryan

Hello Tommy,

Please ask a specific question and I can answer it.  This is too general
a question for me to effectively answer.  Also, the basic information on

Hello MLPack Team:
                           I am a Graduate Student in Electrical
Engineering at National University of Science and Technology,
Pakistan<http://www.nust.edu.pk>.
I am deeply passionate about Machine Learning and have been doing a bunch
of my own private projects. The fact that Google Summer of Code actually
gives me an opportunity to be a part of a Team which is involved in stuff
that I love to do is fascinating.

                           I am hugely interested in the Collaborative
Filtering Package implementation for MLPack. Are there any particular
algorithms that MLPack team have in mind? Or if we can leverage the power
of some other API, e.g., GraphLab, and try to integrate it with MLPack, is
it something that can be considered? I will be grateful for a response.


Best Regards,
Salman Javaid

Hello John,

My own work has brought me back to GMMs in recent weeks and I have come
across the same issues you suggested.

Are you using the svn trunk or mlpack 1.0.4?  If you aren't using trunk,
try doing that ('svn co http://svn.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/mlpack/trunk
mlpack').  I recently committed a fix which adds some small values to
the covariance matrices so that they don't end up being entirely
zero-valued.  That situation arises when the initial clustering to set
the Gaussians returns a cluster with only one point in it (by default
this is K-Means).

I'll try and hunt down the -nan issue, although it is worth pointing out
that the log-likelihood of the model is correctly -nan if there exist
points which are very far outside any of the Gaussians.  That is, if the
probability of an individual point is 0, then log(0) = -nan and the
log-likelihood of the whole model is -nan.  I'll let you know what I
find as I dig into it.  Thanks for attaching the test case -- this makes
debugging much easier.

Thanks for pointing out these issues.

Ryan

Thanks for your help, Ryan!

I'm testing out the latest now. Seems to fix at least one problem. It's
looking like fixing the other may just be a matter of adding trials until
it finds something reasonable, though I'm not sure. I'll be looking at it
closer tomorrow.

the end of the day. =A0r14884 commits the fix.<br>
<br>
The issue was not that the entire covariance matrix was zero but instead<br=

that only one element on the diagonal was zero -- which makes it<br>
non-invertible. =A0This could happen when the points for a particular<br>
cluster have no variance in one dimension (in your case, it was the<br>
fifth dimension). =A0So instead of checking if the sum of the covariance<br=
>
diagonal is zero, now it checks each element and adds a perturbation<br>
accordingly.<br>
<br>
The perturbation is small (1e-50) so it does not affect the results of<br>
the phi() function to get the probability of a point. =A0At the same time,<=
br>
it&#39;s large enough to make the matrix invertible.<br>
<br>
When I have a solution for the second one, I&#39;ll let you know.<br>

Hello there,

Today I heard back from Google and it turns out mlpack has been accepted
into GSoC 2013.  This means that Google will pay students to work on
mlpack over the summer, and is a Very Good Thing (TM).

If you are interested in being a mentor for the project, you can sign up
online:

http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/mlpack

Mentorship involves helping a student complete a project which they have
applied to do, and to my understanding you will get a free t-shirt once
it's all done.  Also, Google pays a stipend of $500 to us for each
accepted student, which, because we don't really have any costs, can go
directly to the mentor.  I need to look further into the precise details
of that.

Uh, yeah, so: mentor a student, get $500 and maybe a t-shirt.

The steps to apply for mentorship should be on the webpage.  If you have
any questions, feel free to email me.

The student questions should start rolling in shortly.  The Shogun
developers told me that they got somewhere around 100 applications last
year...

Ryan

Hello mlpack mailing list members,



As this is my first post to the mailing list, my appreciation to the
developers for creating the wonderful mlpack package.



I have a question regarding mlpack::neighbor::NeighborSearch



I am wondering if it is possible to perform a dynamic kNN search in
mlpack efficiently solving the all-NN problem repeatedly with a
changing point set S.



As far as I know, all previously described methods handle only the
inserting and deleting of points between queries or the case of points
moving along a predetermined trajectories. This is different from the
dynamic problem I have in mind, wherein the points move slowly along
trajectories, but that these trajectories are not known in advance as
in the case of an optimization problem.



The idea is that if the changes between point positions in subsequent
calls to the the mlpack::neighbor::AllkNN search algorithm are
sufficiently small, updating the tree should be faster than rebuilding
it from scratch. The mlpack algorithm would takes a S_i and a
corresponding tree T_i and update the tree to T_i+1 corresponding to a
new set of points S_i+1. A caveat is that the subsequent sets {S_i} and
{S_i+1} will, in general, contain an similar, but not exactly the same,
number of points.



Any insight regarding this question would be most appreciated.



Audrius Stundzia

I have solved one of these, but I may not get to the second problem by
the end of the day.  r14884 commits the fix.

The issue was not that the entire covariance matrix was zero but instead
that only one element on the diagonal was zero -- which makes it
non-invertible.  This could happen when the points for a particular
cluster have no variance in one dimension (in your case, it was the
fifth dimension).  So instead of checking if the sum of the covariance
diagonal is zero, now it checks each element and adds a perturbation
accordingly.

The perturbation is small (1e-50) so it does not affect the results of
the phi() function to get the probability of a point.  At the same time,
it's large enough to make the matrix invertible.

When I have a solution for the second one, I'll let you know.

Oops, one too many 8s there.  I was thinking that number looked a little
large...

Thanks for pointing these issues out.  :)

Hi,

I am currently pursuing MS by Research in the field of image processing and
machine learning at IIIT- Hyderabad, India. I am interested in working for
mlpack this summer in a GSoC project.

I propose to implement techniques for dimensionality reduction and metric
learning.

http://homepage.tudelft.nl/19j49/Matlab_Toolbox_for_Dimensionality_Reduction.html

I think this will be a good addition to mlpack.

There are also many kernel functions which have not been implemented.

http://crsouza.blogspot.in/2010/03/kernel-functions-for-machine-learning.html

What are your views about this?

Best Regards,
Siddharth

Hello,

I am a final year undergrad in  Computer Science at National Institute of
Technology, Surat. I am very interested in working on the Collaborative
Filtering Package for mlpack.  I have previously done an internship in NLP
at IISc, Bangalore and also a short workshop on Speech Technologies at
Carnegie-Mellon - IIIT Delhi, winter school. In my final year project, I am
working on speech emotion recognition. These have mostly involved some form
of Machine Learning - for instance SVMs in case of my current project. I
would really be enthusiastic to work hands on on implementing collaborative
filtering , though I don't have much  background in this particular area. I
have fairly good experience coding in C/C++ and python and I am eager to
read up any background or preparatory material I find.

p.s. to know more of the projects I've worked on visit

There are a number of other projects listed there which are not as
difficult and that don't require such specific domain knowledge.  Since
you have no knowledge of the field, I highly suggest you consider one of
the other ones.  Nevertheless, here are some references that you could
look into...

I would not expect a first (or second) year undergraduate to be able to
effectively tackle this project.  Instead a more likely candidate would
be someone near the completion of an undergraduate degree or a graduate
student who is well-versed with data structures, low-level code
optimization, template metaprogramming, and perhaps somewhat familiar
with some of the papers I listed above.

Hello Joery,

The Train() function accepts vector<arma::Mat<double> > regardless of
the distribution type.  For the discrete distribution, casting the
integers to doubles should work, but this is not an optimal solution:

  arma::Mat<double> handobservations;
  for (uint i = 0; i < hands.size(); i++)
  {
    handobservations << (double) hands[i] << arma::endr;
    handvector.push_back(handobservations);
    handobservations.clear();
  }

In the coming days I will refactor the HMM class so that for
DiscreteDistribution, arma::Mat<int> will be accepted (as it should be).
This will be slightly involved because it means each distribution type
will have to define its own observation type (arma::Mat<int> for
DiscreteDistribution, arma::Mat<double> for GaussianDistribution, and so
forth).

I will also write more complete documentation and a tutorial for HMMs,
and then I'll let you know when that is all done.  In the mean time, the
fix I proposed above should work.  If it doesn't, or you have any other
questions, let me know.

Me again,

I now understand how the observations are supposed to be filled in and 
changed that in my code.
As you mentioned I just needed a transpose of the arma::mat matrices to 
have the observation vector filled in correctly. However it is still 
giving me the same error.
Now I have tried to get it working with a simple piece of hardcoded data 
as follows:

vector<arma::Mat<double> > handvector;
     arma::Mat<double> observations;
     int hidden_states = 5;
     size_t observ_dimension;
     vector<distribution::DiscreteDistribution> emissions;
     arma::mat transitions;

     observations << 5 << 4 << 5 << 5 << arma::endr;
     observations << 2 << 1 << 1 << 2 << arma::endr;
     handvector.push_back(observations);

     hmm::HMM<distribution::DiscreteDistribution> handhmm(hidden_states, 
distribution::DiscreteDistribution(observations.n_rows));

     printf("Ready for training\n");
     handhmm.Train(handvector); //the error comes from calling training 
when looking at my output
     printf("Done training model\n");
     observ_dimension = handhmm.Dimensionality();
     printf("Retrieved dimensionality\n");
     emissions = handhmm.Emission();
     printf("Retrieved emission matrix\n");
     transitions = handhmm.Transition();
     printf("Retrieved transition matrix");

As you see I used 4 columns with 2 datapoints for each observation while 
using only one sequence.
This is a very simple example that is a fictional representation of what 
I put into the observations (when I would use 1 video with a very small 
amount of extracted data).
I initialize the hmm (handhmm) with 5 hidden states (this is just a 
random number I chose as the number of hidden states will be unknown in 
the real case) and a discrete distribution for 2 observations.

Maybe this example can clarify what I am doing and give you insight in 
what I might be doing wrong.
It think it might also be helpful to others to have such an example in 
the documentation.

With kind regards,
Joery

        <pre wrap="">Hey,

 I have yet another question about the hmm from mlpack, more precisely
 about the syntax for observations.
 I wil be using the "Train (const std::vector&lt; arma::mat &gt; &amp;dataSeq)"
 thus without the labeled data so the Baum-welch algorithm will be used.
 But when using it with dataseq filled up with data that is observable i
 get an error: Mat::operator(): out of bounds.
 Here is what I put in there:
   * I have a vectors of integers (which i convert to double for now)
     for each timestamp, thus lets say one vector for each frame of a
     video.
   * These vectors are of variable length (1 or 2)
   * There are multiple video's to train the hmm (obviously :p)
   * Now I use the dataseq as a vector containing the data from all
     videos. Thus lets say I use 5 videos, then the dataseq will have 5
     columns whereby each column contains an arma::mat. This arma::mat
     contains n rows (with n being the number of frames in the
     corresponding video), each row in itself then contains the actual
     vector data that I observed (thus 1 or 2 elements on each row).

 Is this the way that it has to be used or am I using it wrong and do I
 need to put the data per video in dataseq and thus execute the Train
 method for each video.
 I would like to have some more information about how to use the dataseq
 in that function and hope that my explanation above is understandable
 as it is kind of hard to explain.

      <pre wrap="">
The documentation here is somewhat unclear, and I will be fixing that
soon.  The type std::vector&lt;arma::mat&gt; is meant to hold a sequence of
data sequences.  I think you are saying that if you are using 5 videos,
each video is an individual arma::mat stored in the
std::vector&lt;arma::mat&gt;.  Then each point in the arma::mat should contain
one data point in each _column_ (not each row, which is what you wrote).

I suspect that if you transposed your data matrices, it would work.  In
addition to updating the documentation, I'll also add some runtime size
checks so that you'll get something more useful than "Mat::operator():
out of bounds".

That's what this list is for. :)

Sometimes the hardest part of development is producing good
documentation and often times that takes a lot of feedback; so I am very
thankful that you've brought this up, because now it can be improved.

    Me again,<br>
    <br>
    I now understand how the observations are supposed to be filled in
    and changed that in my code.<br>
    As you mentioned I just needed a transpose of the arma::mat matrices
    to have the observation vector filled in correctly. However it is
    still giving me the same error.<br>
    Now I have tried to get it working with a simple piece of hardcoded
    data as follows:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000099">vector&lt;arma::Mat&lt;double&gt; &gt;
      handvector;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arma::Mat&lt;double&gt; observations;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int hidden_states = 5;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size_t observ_dimension;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vector&lt;distribution::DiscreteDistribution&gt; emissions;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arma::mat transitions;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observations &lt;&lt; 5 &lt;&lt; 4 &lt;&lt; 5 &lt;&lt; 5
      &lt;&lt; arma::endr;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observations &lt;&lt; 2 &lt;&lt; 1 &lt;&lt; 1 &lt;&lt; 2
      &lt;&lt; arma::endr;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handvector.push_back(observations);<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hmm::HMM&lt;distribution::DiscreteDistribution&gt;
      handhmm(hidden_states,
      distribution::DiscreteDistribution(observations.n_rows));<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Ready for training\n");<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handhmm.Train(handvector); //the error comes from calling
      training when looking at my output<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Done training model\n");<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observ_dimension = handhmm.Dimensionality();<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Retrieved dimensionality\n");<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emissions = handhmm.Emission();<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Retrieved emission matrix\n");<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transitions = handhmm.Transition();<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Retrieved transition matrix");</font><br>
    <br>
    As you see I used 4 columns with 2 datapoints for each observation
    while using only one sequence.<br>
    This is a very simple example that is a fictional representation of
    what I put into the observations (when I would use 1 video with a
    very small amount of extracted data). <br>
    I initialize the hmm (handhmm) with 5 hidden states (this is just a
    random number I chose as the number of hidden states will be unknown
    in the real case) and a discrete distribution for 2 observations.<br>
    <br>
    Maybe this example can clarify what I am doing and give you insight
    in what I might be doing wrong.<br>
    It think it might also be helpful to others to have such an example
    in the documentation.<br>
    <br>
    With kind regards,<br>
    Joery<br>

Edit: I have also figured out that
observations << 5 << 4 << 5 << 5 << arma::endr;
observations << 2 << 1 << 1 << 2 << arma::endr;
writes to the first row 2 times so I changed that to
observations << 5 << 4 << 5 << 5 << arma::endr << 2 << 1 << 1 << 2 << 
arma::endr;
However that doesn't fix the problem (only brought to my intention that 
it is better to just initialize the arma::mat with a given size and then 
setting the elements individually).

 I have yet another question about the hmm from mlpack, more precisely
 about the syntax for observations.
 I wil be using the "Train (const std::vector&lt; arma::mat &gt; &amp;dataSeq)"
 thus without the labeled data so the Baum-welch algorithm will be used.
 But when using it with dataseq filled up with data that is observable i
 get an error: Mat::operator(): out of bounds.
 Here is what I put in there:
   * I have a vectors of integers (which i convert to double for now)
     for each timestamp, thus lets say one vector for each frame of a

   * These vectors are of variable length (1 or 2)
   * There are multiple video's to train the hmm (obviously :p)
   * Now I use the dataseq as a vector containing the data from all

 Is this the way that it has to be used or am I using it wrong and do I
 need to put the data per video in dataseq and thus execute the Train
 method for each video.
 I would like to have some more information about how to use the dataseq
 in that function and hope that my explanation above is understandable

Hey,

I'm a student in my final year and ran in the exact same problem yesterday.
I have explained this to my mentor and he told me that it would prob be 
the excessive zero values in my training set.
His suggestion was to replace the zero values with a higher and 
extremely unlikely number with some random noise on it. Although his 
idea sounds interesting and could work I haven't had time to try it out 
and think it depends on what you are trying to do whether it will work 
or not.
In my case i have data in 15 dimensions but not every dimension will 
have a value available all the time so I keep them at zero in that case. 
In this case it might just work to give them a high value.

But perhaps someone with more experience has a better and definite 
solution for the problem at hand.

Good luck,
Joery

Sorry for the slow response -- I was out of town for a while.  The
updated Distribution code is available from subversion, so you'll have
to get it using svn:

$ svn co http://svn.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/mlpack/trunk/ mlpack

The next mlpack release, which will probably be in a month or two, will
include those changes, but for now, you can just use what's in the
subversion repositories.

Which techniques are you planning to implement?  Many of those nonlinear
dimensionality techniques are slow.  Instead what would be more
interesting is a working implementation of MVU with LRSDP (see the end
of the ideas list).

There is no purpose in mlpack implementing a variety of methods poorly.
Breadth is important but it cannot come at the cost of quality.

If you are going to propose implementing all (or even some) (or more
than one) of these methods, you will have to convince us that you can
implement all of them effectively.  And with tests.  Proper unit tests
are very important, and, testing machine learning methods for accuracy
-- especially when most of the "tests" available are just reference
implementations which could contain bugs -- is a rather difficult task
which can take far longer than implementing the methods itself.

Also, if you were planning to just wrap the MATLAB functions or
"translate" them to C++, that's not acceptable.  The implementation must
be from the ground up and needs to be provably faster than any existing
implementations to be accepted into the mlpack codebase (of course, you
can't know that when you propose the project, but if you have papers
which detail faster algorithms to implement, those are a good start).

I could implement these, fully with tests, in probably a day and a half.
This could be an addendum onto an existing project but is too simple for
someone with knowledge as advanced as yourself.

Hopefully these are helpful answers.  Let me know if I can clarify
further.

Hello Robert,

OpenCV focuses on computer vision (hence the name) whereas mlpack
focuses on large-scale statistical learning techniques.  mlpack is more
applicable to people who are either looking to try less standard machine
learning algorithms (i.e. sparse coding, LARS, density estimation trees,
etc.) or who are looking to modify our flexible algorithms for the
purposes of their research.  To that end, for instance, any user can
write their own distance metric and plug it in to mlpack code (without
any runtime penalty).

You are right that we aren't very interested in wrapping other libraries
(other than Armadillo).  Some libraries -- especially scientific
libraries (cough cough Boost.math) -- change APIs in unexpected ways and
this makes maintenance an ugly proposition filled with #ifdefs and other
hackery.  Instead, our goal is to, at the machine learning method level,
keep things in-house for the sake of maintainability.

We'd love to have an SVM implementation someday, but there isn't too
much point in producing one if it can't outperform libsvm (if it can't,
there's not too much motivation to use our implementation).

Does this clarify things?  If not, let me know.

Thanks,

Ryan
